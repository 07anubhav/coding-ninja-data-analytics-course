    "* It represents the amount of dispersion in a dataset i.e. how spread out are the values \n",
    "* How far away the data points tend to fall from the center.\n",
    "* This type of measure only applies to ordinal and numeric data that can be ranked\n",

    "* It is the measurement of average distance between each quantity and mean. That is, how data is spread out from mean\n",
    "* It is square root of variance.\n",
    "* A low standard deviation value indicates that the data points tend to be close to the mean, while a high value indicates that the data points are spread out over a wider range of values\n",
