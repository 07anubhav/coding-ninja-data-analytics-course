- All students in class 10


A survey will be given to 100 students randomly selected from the class 10 students of DPS school. What is the sample ?
- The 100 selected students


A mean is known as a statistic if it is computed from the -
- Sample


A medical researcher obtained blood specimens from a simple random sample (SRS)of 31 young children in New Delhi, all of whom were infected with malaria. What group of individuals is the most reasonable choice to serve as the population in this setting?
- all children in New Delhi, who have malaria


Which of the following statements are true?
I. The mean of a population is denoted by x. 
II. Sample size is never bigger than population size. 
III. The population mean is a statistic.
- None of the above (The mean of a population is denoted by μ; not x. When sampling with replacement, sample size can be greater than population size. And the population mean is a parameter; the sample mean is a statistic)


An employee at USC’s SSC office wants to know what percentage of undergraduate students are satisﬁed with the services oﬀered at the SSC. She takes a simple random sample of 100 USC undergraduates and ﬁnds that 77 of them aresatisﬁed. In statistics terminology, the number 77% is -
- Statistic


We take a simple random sample (SRS) of 15 students from a class. What are the deﬁning characteristic of this sample ?
- Each student of class has the same chance of being selected
A student can not appear more than once in the sample


What is the degree to which sample statistics differ from the equivalent population parameter known as ?
- Sampling Error


A truck manufacturer selects 300 trucks at random from each of 600 models for safety testing. Which sampling is this ?
- Stratified Sampling


A company has imported 10000 bulbs from 2 different manufacturing units. The manager wants to take a sample of bulbs to estimate what proportion of bulbs are defective. The manager is planning to use stratified random sampling to take samples from each manufacturing unit.
Why using stratification instead of a simple random sample will be a better way to estimate the defective bulbs ?
- A stratified random sample reduces the likelihood of getting disproportionate numbers of bulbs from manufacturing unit 1 and 2. 


A company has a total of 360 employees in four different categories:
Managers            	36
Drivers              	54
Administrative Staff    90
Production Staff        180
How many employees from drivers category should be included in a proportionate stratified random sample of size 20 ?
- Answer is 3
The proportionate stratified random sample will be obtained using this formula: 
(sample size/population size) x stratum size.
For our case:
Sample size = 20
Population Size = 360
Stratum size(drivers) = 54
(20/360)*54 = 3


Which of the following is a type of Cluster sampling?
- Two-Stage Cluster Sampling


The police set up checkpoints at randomly selected road locations, then inspected every driver at those locations. What type of sample is this?
- Cluster sampling


A teacher puts students' names in a hat and chooses without looking to get a sample of 300 students. What type of sampling is this ?
- Simple random sampling


In systematic sampling, value of k is classified as -
- sampling interval


In systematic sampling, the population is 200 and selected sample size is 50 then sampling interval is -
- Answer is 4
Formula
k={N}/{n}
k	=	systematic sampling interval
{N}	=	population size
{n}	=	sample size
In our problem:
N = 200
n = 50
k = 200/50 = 4


Type of statistics that involves drawing conclusions from sample data analysis to population, is known to be -
- Inferential Statistics


Which among the following is the benefit of using simple random sampling?
- We can calculate the accuracy of the results. (As the chance for every data point to be part of the subset is similar. this is why it will give give accurate result)


Sample is regarded as a subset of?
- Population


A teacher wants to know how well her students are doing on a topic. She randomly picks one class to survey.
- Cluster Sampling


Randomly selecting 3 classes from a school and then investigating these classes further is an example of ?
- Cluster Sampling
