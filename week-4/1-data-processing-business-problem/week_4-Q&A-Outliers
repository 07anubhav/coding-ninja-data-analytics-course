What is an outlier in Statistics/Data Analytics?
A value that is far from the other values in a dataset


State True or False:
Before removing or including the outlier in any analysis, Data Analyst should confirm the scenario with the stakeholder.
True


How do outliers affect the mean of a dataset?
Outliers may increase or decrease the mean, depending on their value and the dataset size.


Which of the following is not a way to deal with outliers?
Ignoring the outlier and using the mean or standard deviation calculated without it


A dataset contains the following values: 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30, and 200. Which value is an outlier?
200


To find outliers, which visualisation method is preferred?
Candlestick Chart


S1: The value of Quartile 2 (Q2) is not equal to the median.
S2: Interquartile range (IQR) can give you an overview of where most of your values lie in the range and how they are clustered between Q3 and Q1.
S1 is False, S2 is True


Which one of the following is correct format for finding Quartile?
=QUARTILE(data,Quartile_number)


Match the following terms:
A) Q1              	1. The median of the upper half of a dataset. 
B) Q2              	2. The difference between Q3 and Q1.
C) Q3              	3. The maximum value of a dataset.
D) Qmax         	4. The median of a dataset.
E) IQR             	5. The median of the lower half of a dataset.
A-5, B-4, C-1, D-3, E-2


What is the difference between Q2 and Q1?
Q2 is the 50th percentile of the data, while Q1 is the 25th percentile


Arrange the following steps in the correct order to find the outlier.
S1: Find IQR for the required column.
S2: Calculate the number of outliers present. (Value 1 represents Outlier)
S3: In the new column, apply the filter or =COUNTIF()
S4: In new column apply this condition, =If( OR(Cell_valueQ3+1.5IQR),1,0)
S5: Calculate all the quartile values(Q1,Q2,Q3)
S5 > S1 > S4 > S3 > S2


What are the quartiles in a dataset with ten observations if the data are sorted in increasing order?
Dataset: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
Q1 = 3.25, Q2 = 5.5, Q3 = 7.75


How is the IQR used to identify outliers in a dataset?
Any value greater than Q3 + 1.5IQR or less than Q1 - 1.5IQR is considered an outlier


Using the Quartile method, find out how many outliers are present in the following columns.
A. Amount of Sweet products
B. Number of Web purchases
248,4
