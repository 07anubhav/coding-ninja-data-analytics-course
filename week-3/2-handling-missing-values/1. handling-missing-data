HANDLING MISSING DATA:
	# Why it is required to handle the missing value?
		* Many machine learning algorithm requires a complete data set
		* Handling the missing values will impact the mathematical or analytical results for the business problem

	# How missing values are represented
		* Blank and Null
		* Space
		* Special characters
		* Random Numbers
		* Big Value

		* =COUNTA() : is the function that counts the number of values in a particular column, it only counts if there is value in that particular cell

	# If 2-3% of data is having missing values, the we will do Data Imputing (That means giving some values to the missing cells).

VARIANCE: If suppose we have given a particular value then how other values will be varying from that particular one value

HOW TO IMPUTE MISSING VALUES?
	# If the Standard deviation is similar/ near to Average or bigger value, then we replace the missing value with Median
	# If the Standard deviation is less than the average value or has a small value that means values are clustered near to Average, then we replace the missing value with the Average
