VLOOKUP : Vertical lookup
		: VLOOKUP function looks up a value in the first column of a given range and returns a value in the same row from another column. The letter "V" stands for "vertical" as it searches for the value in the vertical direction (column).

=VLOOKUP(SEARCH KEY, RANGE, INDEX, IS SORTED)
	
SEARCH KEY	: it's key identifier
RANGE		: from where we need to pull the data
INDEX		: which columns you need 
IS SORTED	: it ask that do you want to sort the data before joining it?
			  '0' means NOT SORT, based on value of ID
			  '1' means TO SORT, based on position of ID

IMPORTRANGE	: it is used when the other table is present in the other workbook, use in RANGE

We use '$' sign as like A2:E2241 is the range that we want to keep constant for all the rows, so to keep it constant we need to up a $ sign $A$2:$E$2241. That means we are freezing that particular cell value.

=ARRAYFORMULA()	: We want to apply the particular VLOOKUP formula to the complete row that we have give in the VLOOKUP function

FORMULA:
=ARRAYFORMULA(VLOOKUP(A2,IMPORTRANGE("https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cPj3vL03NUeC5PvkC6GWOr_f5eVXD5j1gviJr96GIqw/edit#gid=786551142","marketing_campaign_df2!$A$2:$E$2241"),{2,3,4,5},0))
