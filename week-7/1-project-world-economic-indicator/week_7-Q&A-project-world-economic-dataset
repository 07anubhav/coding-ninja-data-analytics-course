How would you handle the missing values in GDP dataset?
By imputing them with their corresponding region previous year’s value
(You will first sort the dataset in ascending order to region and year and then To handle missing values, you are replacing the missing value with the same country/Region’s previous year value. If the previous year's value is also missing, then leave it as it is.
You will check two conditions for the same, i.e., 
1) You are replacing the missing value with the same country/Region’s previous year's value.
2) If the cell’s value is blank, i.e. missing value, only then you will replace it with the previous year’s value, else that cell will hold its original value.)
