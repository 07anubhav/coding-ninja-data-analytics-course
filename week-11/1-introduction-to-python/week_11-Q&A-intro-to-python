Will id1 and id2 have same value?
a = 10
id1 = id(a)
b = a + 2-2
id2 = id(b)
- Yes (In python, the values are stored in a separate memory. And an address/id is stored in the variable, which points to that memory location. So, if “10” is stored in both “a” and “b”, the id is going to be the same for both of these.)



Choose the correct answer
a = 10
b = 10
c = 12
print(id(a))
print(id(b))
print(id(c))
A and B will have the same memory ID. C will have a different memory ID.
