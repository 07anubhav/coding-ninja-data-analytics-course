    "# Data Visualisation\n",
    "* Data visualisation refers to techniques used to communicate insights from data through visual representation.\n",
    "* It means visually presenting data using charts, graphs and maps. \n",
    "* Data Visualization is the art of presenting the data so that any person from a non-technical background canalso understand. \n",
    "* Also, It allows Data analysts to converse with their end-users.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Visual Analytics\n",
    "* It plays an important role in understanding complex information, as our human brain understands visual information faster and better rather than text information\n",
    "\n",
    "## Need of Visualisation\n",
    "* Using visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps, data visualisation tools provide an accessible way to see and understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.\n",
    "* The amount of information that humans gain through vision is far beyond other organs.\n",
    "* So Visualisation is used to analyse a massive amount of data and make decisions based on data.\n",
    "* Visualisation can help us deal with more complex information and enhance memory\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importance of Visualisation\n",
    "* Help in quickly understanding the data.\n",
    "* It simplifies large datasets in a way that people can easily interpret.\n",
    "* It shows trends that may not be apparent at first glance\n",
    "* Identify areas that need attention or improvement.\n",
    "* Offers new insights into your data\n",
    "* Quickly identify outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Data Visualisation\n",
    "### Exploratory Analysis:\n",
    "   * It is done during data analysis to find insights\n",
    "   * It is appropriate when you have a bunch of data and you’re unsure what’s in it.\n",
    "   * Visualisations built for these purposes do not need to be perfect. You are simply looking for patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanatory Analysis:\n",
    "   * It is done after you find insight.\n",
    "   * It is appropriate when you already know what the data has to say, and it helps you when you are trying to tell that story to somebody else.\n",
    "   * It helps in getting an answer in the form of the story"
