The separator character of CSV files is called delimiter.

Why is Panda Package used in python ?
- Pandas is a Python package providing fast, flexible, and expressive data structures designed to make working with “relational” or “labeled” data both easy and intuitive.
It aims to be the fundamental high-level building block for doing practical, real world data analysis in Python.


Pandas is well suited for many different kinds of data:
- Pandas works on tabular data with heterogeneously-typed columns, as in an SQL table or Excel spreadsheet.
Pandas can work on Ordered and unordered time series data.
Pandas can also work on arbitrary matrix data (homogeneously typed or heterogeneous) with row and column labels.


A _______________ is a two-dimensional labelled data structure .
- DataFrame


import pandas as pd     
iris=pd.read_csv(“https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data”)
df = iris
Any changes done in df will reflect in iris
- True


import pandas as pd     
iris=pd.read_csv(“https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data”)
df = iris.copy()
Changes via df will reflect in iris.
- False


Which statement is true about iris dataset:
- The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor).
In iris dataset 4 features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimetres.


What all statements are true:
- Scikit focus on modeling data.
Scikit not focused on loading, manipulating and summarizing data.
NumPy and Pandas are used for loading, manipulating and summarizing data features.


import pandas as pd   
iris=pd.read_csv(“https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data”)
Pick the correct option to summarize how many null entry in each column
- iris.isnull().sum()


From the iris dataset used, Pick the correct statement to get data from row 1 to 3 with only 2nd column
- iris.iloc[1:4, 2:3]


import pandas as pd   
iris=pd.read_csv(“https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data”)
iris.drop(0)
print(iris)
Above code will result in -
- No changes in iris dataframe


import pandas as pd   
iris=pd.read_csv(“https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data”)
iris.drop(0, inplace = True)
drop method in above code makes which one of the following changes in iris dataframe
- Delete one row in iris dataframe itself


import pandas as pd   
iris=pd.read_csv(“https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/iris/iris.data”)
iris.drop(0,inplace= True)
iris.drop(0,inplace= True)
print(iris)
what will be the output -
- Error


Which is true?
- a) Pandas support non-unique index values. If an operation that does not support duplicate index values is attempted, an exception will be raised at that time.
b) Pandas supports label based indexing. “.loc” is primarily label based, but may also be used with a boolean array. .loc will raise KeyError when the items are not found.
c) Pandas used the range method for implicit indexing. Pandas provide a suite of methods in order to get purely integer based indexing. The semantics follow closely python and NumPy slicing. These are 0-based indexing. When slicing, the start bounds is included, while the upper bound is excluded. Trying to use a non-integer, even a valid label will raise an IndexError. The .iloc attribute is the primary access method. 


In pandas, Index values must be?
- unique & hashable


Which of the following statements are true:
- The describe() method is used for calculating some statistical data like percentile, mean and std of the numerical values of the Series or DataFrame.
It analyzes both numeric and object series and also the DataFrame column sets of mixed data types.
It returns the statistical summary of the Series and DataFrame.


To display 3 rows from the bottom of a data frame which of the following can be written?
(i) df.tail(3)
(ii) df.iloc[-3:]
- both are correct


Which statement select rows in a pandas DataFrame with condition "column_name" has values greater than 10?
- df[ df.column_name > 10 ]


Which of the following is used to drop a column in pandas in the data frame itself ?
- df.drop("column_name", axis=1, inplace=True)


Which feature will separate the Flower 1 from flower 2 & 3?
- pl, pw


How to reset index in pandas dataframe without saving it as a column?
- df.reset_index(drop=True)


What is the use of the axis parameter?
- Sometimes we need to do operations only on rows, and sometimes only on columns, in such situations, we specify the axis parameter.
When the axis is set to zero while performing a specific action, the action is performed on rows that satisfy the condition.
When the axis is set to one while performing a specific action, the action is performed on column(s) that satisfy the condition.


Which of the following ways can be used to delete a column in pandas?
- df.drop('column_name', axis=1, inplace=True)
del df['column_name']


A DataFrame has columns "col1" and "col2", which statement is correct to create a new column "total" by adding columns col1 and col2 ?
- data["total"] = data["col1"] + data["col2"]


Which of the following is used to generate a data frame based on two conditions,  the first condition is df[“col1”]> 23 and the second condition is df [“col2”]% 2 == 0 ?
- masked_df = df[ (df[“col1”] > 23) & (df[“col2”] % 2 == 0) ]


The function to fill in NAN values with 10,if df is the dataframe object?
- df.fillna(10)


What is the function used to drop the rows with NAN values?
- dropna()


............... can be used to detect missing values for a dataframe object df
- isnull()	


Which method should be used in pandas to add a column to a specific position in a DataFrame ?
- insert() [DataFrame.insert(loc, column, value)]
