    1 1
    2 0
    2 1

Arrange the code to get the reverse of a number:
rev= 0  
n= 1567  
while (n > 0): 
   1) rev = (rev * 10) + rem 
   2) n = n // 10 
   3) rem = n % 10  
 print(rev)  
- 3->1->2


Complete the code to calculate the product of all numbers from 1 to num.
num=6
product = 1
for i in range(1, #stop ):
   #condition
print(product)
- for i in range(1, num+1): 
    product *= I

    if i==3:
        break
    print(i,end=" ")
    i = i +1

            break
        print(j,end=" ")
        j = j + 1
    i = i + 1

else:
    print(“Else is also printed”);
- 1 2 3 4 Else is also printed
