DATA ANALYSIS:
	- It is a process of gathering, cleaning, modifying, processing the data to gain some meaningful insight to solve some complex problems and to help our stakeholders in decision making.


WHAT IS DATA:
	- DATA are simply facts or figures - bits of information, but not information itself. 
	- When data are processed, interpreted, organized, structured or presented so as to make them meaningful or useful, they are called INFORMATION.
	- The process of converting "Data" to "Information" is called DATA PROCESSING.


DIFFERENT TYPES OF DATA:
	1. STRUCTURED DATA		: Any data that is in form of tabular form (Rows and Columns), each column will have it's own meaning. The sturctured data is used as an input of data analysis.

	2. UN-STRUCTURED DATA	: Data which is not structured nor semi-structured, Examples: Images, Audio files, Voice command.

	3. SEMI-STRUCTURED DATA	: Data which have some kind of structure, that structure is not always fixed it'll keep on changing from one data source to another. Example: Machine log, transaction log etc.


TYPE OF DATA ANALYSIS:
	1. DESCRIPTIVE	: Helps you understand what has happened in the past, gives you an analysis of past data. 
	Ex: A company wants to understand how there revenue has been changing year on year.

	2. DIAGNOSTIC	: Helps you understand why exactly that particular thing happened (root cause analysis). 
	Ex: Let suppose the company revenue is going down and company wants to understand why it's going down.

	3. PREDICTIVE	: Helps you understand what will happen in the future. Helps in finding out the expected or forecasted value of something based on certain factors or features of particular thing.
	Ex: A company wants to understand how there revenue has been changing year on year and based on that it'll be predicting what can be the future revenue.

	4. PRESCRIPTIVE	: Combination of all above 3 types of data analysis to prescribe or recommend a particular action or strategy, after gathering and doing analysis we can explain our stakeholders that what can be done to increase the revenue of the company in coming years.
