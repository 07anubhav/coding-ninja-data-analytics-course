Let's understand what type of data analysis is done on different types of datasets:
	# Continous Data
		* Ex: Age, Amount of fruits
	# Categorical Data
		* Ex: Marital status, Gender, Education level

TYPES OF ANALYSIS:
	# Univariate Analysis
	# Bivariate Analysis
	# Multivariate Analysis


UNIVARIATE ANALYSIS:
	# For Contiuous Data 	: Mean, Mode, Median, Distribution of data, Using Histogram, Box Plot etc.
	# For Categorical Data 	: Frequency table

BIVARIATE ANALYSIS:
	# For Contiuous Data 	: Scatter plot, Correlation
	# For Categorical Data 	: Frequency table, Contigency table

UNIVARIATE METHOD - CONTINUOUS:
	# Univariate analysis helps us to answer the following few questions by the stakeholders:
		* what is the distribution of the age of customer?
		* what is the mean or average age of customer?
		* what is the median income of the customer?

	# Types of Univariate analysis that can be done on Continuous Features are as follows:
		* Average/Mean
		* Trim Mean 	: !!! This will actually help us by removing the outliers that may be present in the dataset.!!!
						  Sort the data then remove few data from the top and bottom. Ex: remove the top most and bottom most data and then again take the mean.
		* Median
		* Min
		* Max
		* Standard Deviation
		* Variance

	# Distribution:
		* Percentile (Quartile)
		* IQR
		* Box Plot
		* Histogram
			> Bin: After creating the histogram we will get the range of values, The bin column it is a range of values for a particular feature/column that how many data points are present in that particular range.
		* Density plot

UNIVARIATE METHOD - CATEGORICAL:
	# Pivot Table:
		* A PivotTable is a powerful tool to calculate, summarize, and analyze data that lets you see comparisons, patterns, and trends in 	 your data .
