The shape of the Normal Curve is ___________
- Bell Shaped


The measurement techniques used to measure the extent of skewness in data set values are called:
- The measure of Skewness


If the distribution is negatively skewed, then the:
- The mean is less than mode (Left Skewed: Mean < Median < Mode (Mean is not able to represent central part of data). So, we will take help of median to represent central part of data)


Rebecca wants to know how many books students in her school read over summer vacation. She attends a large school, and doesn’t have time to ask every student. Which of the following would best allow her to make generalizations about all students in her school ?
- Select 40 students from her school at random (For generalizations, the sample should be selected from the population. Here the population is all the students from her school)


What is the purpose of an inferential statistical test ?
- To check the probability of your results applying to the wider population


A random variable is -
- a variable whose value is a numerical outcome associated with a random phenomenon.


Which of the following is not a random variable?
- The suit of a card randomly selected from a 52-card deck is not a random variable because the outcome will be the same for selecting any suit.


Which of the following random variables is NOT continuous ?
- Number of goals scored by a hockey team.


Which one of the following is a discrete random variable ?
- The number of Sam's brothers and sisters is a discrete random variable. All other are continuous.
Sam's height
Sam weight
Time Sam takes in running the 110 m hurdles


Classify: The numbers of cheeseburgers a fast-food restaurant serves each day
- Discrete


What shape is a normal distribution curve ?
- Bell curve


Standard Normal Distribution helps in Detecting Outliers?
- True


The z-score represents ?
- The z-score represents the number of standard deviations a data value is above or below the mean.


The monthly phone bills in a city are normally distributed with a mean of 30$ and a standard deviation of 12$. Find the x-value that correspond to z-scores of 3.17
- 68.04
The formula for Z score is:
z = (x – μ) / σ


μ = 70 , σ = 8 , X = 50 . Find z-score
- -2.5


The shape of the sampling Distribution reveals the shape of population ?
- False


28% of all Woodrow students believe Monday will be snow day. You take a sample of 50 students and find that 15 of them believe Monday will be a snow day. What does 50 represent?
- Sample size


What happens to the shape of a sampling distribution of sample means as n increases?
- It becomes narrower and more normal.


These symbols represent the mean and standard deviation for which of the following distributions?
x̅ and Sx
- The sample


These symbols represent the mean and standard deviation for which of the following distributions?
μM and σM
- The Sampling Distribution


These symbols represent the mean and standard deviation for which of the following distributions?
μ and σ
- The Population


The mean and standard deviation of a population are 200 and 20, respectively. The sample size is 25.
What is the mean of the sampling distribution?
- 200
The central limit theorem gives a formula for the sample mean and the sample standard deviation when the population mean and standard deviation are known. This is given as follows: 
Sample mean = Population mean = μ
Sample standard deviation = (Population standard deviation) / √n = σ / √n.


The mean and standard deviation of a population are 200 and 20, respectively. Sample size is 25.
What is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution?
- 4
The central limit theorem gives a formula for the sample mean and the sample standard deviation when the population mean and standard deviation are known. This is given as follows: 
Sample mean = Population mean = μ
Sample standard deviation = (Population standard deviation) / √n = σ / √n.
In our example, the standard deviation is:
20/(root(25)) = 20/5 = 4.


Which of the following are types of correlation?
- Positive and negative correlation.
Linear and non-linear correlation.
Simple, multiple, and partial correlation.


Which of the following is true for the coefficient of correlation?
- The coefficient of correlation is not dependent on both the change of scale and change of origin


Which of the following statements is true for correlation analysis?
- Correlation analysis in research is a statistical method used to measure the strength of the linear relationship between two variables and compute their association. Simply put - correlation analysis calculates the level of change in one variable due to the change in the other. It is both bivariate and multivariate analysis.


If the values of two variables move in the same direction, ___________
- The correlation is said to be positive


If the values of two variables move in the opposite direction, ___________
- The correlation is said to be negative
