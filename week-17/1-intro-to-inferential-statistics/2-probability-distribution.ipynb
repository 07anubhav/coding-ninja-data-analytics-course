    "# Probability Distribution\n",
    "* In statistics, with distribution we usually mean probability distribution\n",
    "* A probability distribution is a function that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur.\n",
    "* A probability distribution is a list of all of the possible outcomes of a random variable along with their corresponding probability values.\n",
    "* For eg. rolling a dice, tossing a coin, measuring weight of a student etc\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of probability distribution:\n",
    "* **Discrete probability distributions** for discrete variables\n",
    "* **Probability density functions** for continuous variables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Discrete probability distribution (Probability Mass Functions):\n",
    "* For example - coin tosses, rolling a dice\n",
    "* Each possible value has a non-zero likelihood\n",
    "* The probabilities for all possible values must sum to one\n",
    "* There are a variety of discrete probability distributions that you can use to model different types of data. The correct discrete distribution depends on the properties of your data. \n",
    "* Types of Discrete Distribution\n",
    "     * **Binomial distribution:** Which can have only 2 outcomes. Ex: Tossing coin\n",
    "     * **Poisson distribution:** If we have data which represent count of data. Ex: count of books, count of cars\n",
    "     * **Uniform distribution:** \n",
    "     \n",
    "## Continuous Probability Distribution (Probability Density Functions):\n",
    "* For example - often measurements on a scale, such as height, weight, and temperature.\n",
    "* Specific values in continuous distributions have a zero probability. For example, the likelihood of measuring a temperature that is exactly 32 degrees is zero (because an individual value has an infinitesimally small probability that is equivalent to zero)\n",
    "* Probabilities for continuous distributions are measured over ranges of values rather than single points. \n",
    "* A probability indicates the likelihood that a value will fall within an interval.\n",
    "* On a probability plot, the entire area under the distribution curve equals 1. This fact is equivalent to how the sum of all probabilities must equal one for discrete distributions. \n",
    "* The most well-known continuous distribution is the **Normal Distribution**"

    "# Normal Distribution\n",
    "* A normal distribution is the most common and widely used distribution in statistics because it approximates to a wide variety of random variables\n",
    "* It is also called a \"bell curve\" and \"Gaussian curve\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Characteristics of normal distribution:\n",
    "* Mean = Median = Mode\n",
    "* It is symmetric, perfectly centred around mean\n",
    "* The area under the curve is 1.\n",
    "* The entire family of normal distribution is differentiated by two parameters - \n",
    "    * Mean (it determines the location of distribution) and Standard Deviation (it determines how flat or wide our curve is/it deifnes measure of variations)\n",
    "    * It is denoted as - N ~ (µ,σ^2)\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Standard normal distribution\n",
    "* The standard normal distribution is a special case of the normal distribution - \n",
    "    * when a normal random variable has a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1\n",
    "* So if we shift the mean by µ and the standard deviation by µ for any normal distribution we will arrive at the standard normal distribution. We use the letter Z to denote it\n",
    "* **Z = (X - µ) / σ**\n",
    "* The normal random variable of a standard normal distribution is called a **standard score or a z score**.\n",
    "* The z-score represents the number of standard deviations a data value is above or below the mean."

    "# Sampling Distribution\n",
    "* A Sampling Distribution is a probability distribution of a statistic obtained through a large number of samples drawn from a specific population.\n",
    "* For example, consider a normal population with mean µ and variance σ. \n",
    "* Assume we repeatedly take samples of a given size from this population and calculate the arithmetic mean for each sample. This statistic is then called the sample mean. Each sample has its own average value, and the distribution of these averages is called the “sampling distribution of the sample mean.\n",
    "* A Sampling Distribution behaves much like a normal curve and has some interesting properties like :\n",
    "    * The shape of the Sampling Distribution does not reveal anything about the shape of the population.\n",
    "    * Sampling Distribution helps to estimate the population statistic, using Central Limit Theorem\n",
    "* **Sample standard deviation = (Population standard deviation) / √n = σ / √n.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Central Limit Theorem (CLT):\n",
    "* Sampling distribution can be very useful in making inferences about the overall population\n",
    "*  To find - how much sample means differ from each other, we’ll use standard deviation of the sampling distribution \n",
    "* This standard deviation is called the **standard error**.\n",
    "    * **Standard error (SE) = s/sqrt(n)**\n",
    "* The central limit theorem states (given that sample size >= 30) - \n",
    "    * The sampling distribution of the sample mean has an approximately normal distribution. \n",
    "    * The mean of the sampling distribution is equals to the population mean\n",
    "    * The standard deviation of the sampling distribution equals the standard deviation in the population divided by the square root of the sample size (i.e. standard error)\n"
