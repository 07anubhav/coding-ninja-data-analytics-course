    "# What is hypothesis testing\n",
    "* Hypotheses are always statements or assumptions about the population which we want to verify.\n",
    "* For Example:\n",
    "    * Will I improve my grades if I spend 4 hrs studying daily ?\n",
    "    * If breakfast helps children perform better in schools ?\n",
    "    * If the average time that college students spend studying each week is 20 hours per week \n",
    "* It is an idea made from limited evidence, and is a starting point of further investigation.\n",
    "* This is where you can use the sample data to answer the research questions.\n",
    "* A Famous saying - \n",
    "    * **A fact is a simple statement that everyone believes. It is innocent, unless found guilty.** \n",
    "    * **A hypothesis is a novel suggestion that no one wants to believe. It is guilty, until found effective.**\n",
    "* Formal definition - **“Hypothesis testing is an inferential procedure that uses sample data to evaluate the credibility of a hypothesis about a population.”**\n",
    "* A hypothesis test is a rule that specifies whether to accept or reject a claim about a population depending on the evidence provided by a sample of data.\n",
    "* Hypothesis testing is a kind of statistical inference that involves asking a question, collecting data, and then examining what the data tells us about how to proceed\n",
    "\n",
    "# Null & Alternate Hypothesis:\n",
    "### Null Hypothesis (H0)\n",
    "    * In hypothesis testing, we begin by making a tentative assumption about population parameter. This tentative assumption is called null hypothesis.\n",
    "    * A statement about the population parameter i.e. the statement which we want to test\n",
    "    * Can include : =, >= , <=\n",
    "### Alternate Hypothesis (H1 or HA)\n",
    "    * A statement that directly contradicts Null Hypothesis\n",
    "    * Can include : ≠, >, <\n",
    "### Examples\n",
    "* A school claims that on an average their students get at least 70% marks\n",
    "    * Claim - Average marks >= 70% - Null\n",
    "    * Counterclaim - Average marks < 70% - Alternate\n",
    "* According to a survey, average number of hours spent by phd students in their research work is more than 10 hours per day\n",
    "    * Claim - Average hours > 10 hrs - Alternate\n",
    "    * Counterclaim - Average hours <= 10 hrs - Null\n",
    "* A company states that average life of their car tyres is 36 months.\n",
    "    * Claim - Average life = 36 months - Null\n",
    "    * Counterclaim - Average life ≠ 36 months - Alternate\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Significance Level (Probability of error)\n",
    "* It is denoted by Alpha\n",
    "* Refers to the degree of significance in which we accept or reject the null\u0002hypothesis.\n",
    "* **It is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis, if it is true.**\n",
    "* Typical values for Alpha are - **0.01, 0.05, 0.1**\n",
    "* The choice of Alpha is determined by the context you are operating in but 0.05 or 5% is the most commonly used value. \n",
    "* Alpha = 0.05 means, your output should be 95% confident to give similar kind of result in each sample.\n",
    "* Based on the level of significance, we make a decision to accept the Null or Alternate hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "# Test Statistics\n",
    "* Let suppose now we decided to work on a hypothesis (to work on a particular question)\n",
    "    * pick a random sample\n",
    "    * define null and alternate hypothesis : this null hypothesis can be accepted (fail to reject) or rejected \n",
    "    * set the significance level \n",
    "    * find Test statistics (we can find a value which we can decide to accept or reject the null hypothesis) or calculate P-value\n",
    "    * Find critical statistics\n",
    "    * compare **Test statistics** and **Critical statistics**\n",
    "* To decide the rejection or acceptance of Null hypothesis, we can use - \n",
    "    * Test statistic\n",
    "    * P value\n",
    "* **A Test statistic is a random variable that is calculated from sample data and used in a hypothesis test.**\n",
    "* It is used to determine whether to reject or accept the null hypothesis\n",
    "* There are 4 test statistics which we can use in hypothesis testing - \n",
    "    * **Z-test : Z-score**\n",
    "    * **T-test : T-score**\n",
    "    * **ANOVA : F-statistic**\n",
    "    * **Chi-square test : Chi-square statistic**\n",
    "* The calculated **test statistic** is compared to the respective **critical statistic** to decide the rejection or acceptance of null hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "## Z-Score:\n",
    "* Z-test is a statistical test which is used when - \n",
    "* Data is normally distributed \n",
    "* Sample size is large, i.e. n >= 30\n",
    "* Expression for z-test : **z = (x – μ) / σ**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Critical value (To decide the rejection or acceptance of null hypothesis):\n",
    "* In statistical hypothesis testing, the critical values of a statistical test are the boundaries of the acceptance region of the test.\n",
    "* If a test statistic on one side of the critical value results in accepting the null hypothesis, a test statistic on the other side will result in rejecting the null hypothesis.\n",
    "* Steps for using critical value in hypothesis testing - \n",
    "    * Calculate the test statistic\n",
    "    * Calculate critical values based on significance level (alpha)\n",
    "    * Compare test statistic with critical values\n",
    "### Critical Region or Rejection Region:\n",
    "    * Rejection region represents a set of values for the test statistic, for which the null hypothesis is rejected.\n",
    "    * If the observed test statistic is in the critical region then we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis\n",
    "    \n",
    "## Type of Tests\n",
    "*Depending on the nature of alternate hypothesis, nature of statistical test will be used\n",
    "* Different type of tests\n",
    "    * Left tailed test\n",
    "    * Right tailed test\n",
    "    * Two tailed test\n",
    "* Rules:\n",
    "    * If there is less than sign in **alternate hypothesis**, then we use left tail test\n",
    "    * If there is greater than sign in **alternate hypothesis** then we use right tail test\n",
    "    * If there is not equal sign in **alternate hypothesis** then we use two tail test\n",
    "    \n",
    "# Errors in Hypothesis testing\n",
    "* We have 2 claims to be tested - Null hypothesis and alternate hypothesis. Only one of them can be true.\n",
    "* Ideally we should not reject the null hypothesis when it is true and we should reject it when it is false (or alternate hypothesis is true)\n",
    "* There are 2 types of errors - \n",
    "    * Type 1 error \n",
    "    * Type 2 error\n",
    "## Type 1 error:\n",
    "    * When you reject a true null hypothesis\n",
    "    * It is also called a **False positive**\n",
    "    * The probability of making this error is alpha, the level of significance\n",
    "    * An α of 0.05 indicates that you are willing to accept a 5% chance that you are wrong when you reject the null hypothesis. \n",
    "## Type 2 error:\n",
    "    * When you accept a false null hypothesis.\n",
    "    * The probability of making this error is denoted by Beta \n",
    "    * We should also mention that the probability of rejecting a false null hypothesis is : 1 - Beta\n",
    "    * This is the researchers goal to reject a false null hypothesis.\n",
    "    * Therefore (1 - Beta) is called “The Power of the test” \n",
    "    * Bigger value of alpha then creating type-2 error will be less"
