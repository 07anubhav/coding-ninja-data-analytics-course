A statement made about a population for testing purposes is called?
- Hypothesis


A hypothesis which defines the population distribution is called?
- Simple Hypothesis


If the null hypothesis is false then which of the following is accepted?
- If the null hypothesis is false then the Alternative Hypothesis is accepted. It is also called as Research Hypothesis.


The rejection probability of the Null Hypothesis when it is true is called?
- The level of Significance is defined as the probability of rejection of a True Null Hypothesis. Below this probability, a Null Hypothesis is rejected.


Which of the following is defined as the rule or formula to test a Null Hypothesis?
- Test statistic provides a basis for testing a Null Hypothesis. A test statistic is a random variable that is calculated from sample data and used in a hypothesis test.


The region of rejection of H0 is called
- Critical Region


The point where the Null Hypothesis gets rejected is called?
- The point where the Null Hypothesis gets rejected is called Critical Value. It is also called a dividing point for the separation of the regions where the hypothesis is accepted and rejected.


If population standard deviation is unknown and then appropriate test statistics mean the comparison is
- If population standard deviation is unknown and then appropriate test statistics mean the comparison is a T-test. A t-test is a type of inferential statistic used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups, which may be related to certain features.



Consider a hypothesis H0 where ϕ0 = 5 against H1 where ϕ1 > 5. The test is?
- Right tailed test (In the given example since H1 lies to the right of the Ho that is the Null Hypothesis the test is referred to as a Right tailed test)


Type 1 error occurs when?
- In Testing of Hypothesis Type 1 error occurs when we reject H0 if it is True. On the contrary, a Type 2 error occurs when we accept H0 if it is False.


The probability of Type 1 error is referred to as?
- In Testing of Hypothesis Type 1 error occurs when we reject H0 if it is True. If the probability of H0 is α then the error probability will be 1- α.
